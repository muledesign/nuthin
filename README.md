Nuthin

Welcome friend. You've found yourself at Mule Design Studio's very special CSS reset sheet.

Based partially on [Jayden Seric's awesome article](http://jaydenseric.com/blog/forget-normalize-or-resets-lay-your-own-css-foundation) on resets, with some useful chunks taken from the old standby, [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).

## nuthin.css
A plain CSS file that's washed-and-ready for consumption. Includes helpful comments.

## nuthin.min.css
Minified version, for all the byte-pinchers out there.
