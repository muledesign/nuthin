Welcome friend. You've found youreslf at Mule Design Studio's very special CSS reset sheet. 

Based partially on [Jayden Seric's awesome article](http://jaydenseric.com/blog/forget-normalize-or-resets-lay-your-own-css-foundation) on resets, with some useful chunks taken from the old standby, [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css).

## nuthin.scss
The Sass version, which includes an option to disable `box-sizing:border-box` on block level elements.

## nuthin.css
A compiled version that's washed-and-ready for consumption. Note: this has `box-sizing:border-box` turned on for block level elements.
